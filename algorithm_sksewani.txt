Description:
In this assignment we need to format the date entered by user and convert it into a standard format. The Date of birth conversion script should take dates in following four formats: YYYYMMDD, YYYY/MM/DD YYYY-MM-DD, and YYYY.MM.DD and return the entered date in a mmm d, yyyy, where mmm is three letter abbreviated months name, d is day of the month and yyyy is four-digit year. If user enters, 19951229 the script will return Dec 29,1995.


ALGORITHM FOR ASSIGNMENT :

	1.	Take the first data item from the user (either YYYYMMDD, YYYY/MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD, or YYYY.MM.DD).
	2.	Check if user entered correct argument

		a.	Verify the number of arguments entered by the user. If it s more than one exit the program and return an error message suggesting the user to enter a valid argument.
		b.	Remove all the non-digits characters /, -, .. Thus, the data will be in YYYYMMDD format.

	3.	Extract the year, month, and day from the input data and store it in three separate variables year, month, and date, respectively.

	4.	Validate the input data using a function called validate this function will take date, month and year as input and return true or false if: 
		a.	The value of month entered is less than 12.
		b.	The year entered is greater than or equal to 1900.
		c.	Date of birth should not be greater than present date.
		d.	Checks if year entered is a leap year so that we can verify date for the month of February.
		e.	The date entered is not greater than the maximum number of days in that month.

		If the return value is false it will print an error message suggesting the user to change the input value. If true it will execute the next command in the __main__ function.

	5.	Convert the 2-digit month to a three-letter name for the given month. 

	6.	Rearrange the year, month, and day into the required format: mmm d, yyyy; where mmm is one of Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
